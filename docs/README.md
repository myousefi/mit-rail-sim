# MIT RailSim Documentation

Welcome to the MIT RailSim documentation! While the full package isn't open-source right now, this documentation is a great way to learn about the capabilities of the rail simulation tool. Built on decades of research at (MIT Transit Lab)[https://www.transitlab.mit.edu/], RailSim enables you to simulate operations of an urban rapid transit metro line operations under Fixed-block or Moving-block signal system, integrating real-time control strategies, and finally analyzing the performance of the system from operator's or passenger's perspective.

Whether you're a transportation professional, academic researcher, or just a rail enthusiast, this documentation will help you understand how RailSim works and what it can do. Check out the guides, dive into the architecture reference, and start exploring how RailSim could help with your own projects or research.

## Key Documentation Files

The complete documentation is available as a PDF file: [MIT RailSim Documentation](_build/latex/mitrailsim.pdf).

An online version is also available through Github Pages at [myousefi.github.io/mit-rail-sim-docs/](https://myousefi.github.io/mit-rail-sim-docs/).


## Additional Resources

For further information and resources, refer to the appendix. It contains a glossary of terms used throughout the documentation and provides links to additional dissertations, and relevant papers.
